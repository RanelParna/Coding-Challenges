A collection of diverse mathematical and algorithmic challenges solved using the Wolfram Language.

* LatticeBallCount: Functions to count integer lattice points within a 3D sphere. Includes both a brute-force method and an optimized geometric approach.

* MagicSquareQ: A function to check if a given matrix is a magic square, ensuring that the sum of integers in each row, column, and main diagonals are equal and that the matrix includes all integers from 1 to n² for an n×n matrix.

* MaxColorDistance: An algorithm to identify the most perceptually distinct pairs of colors in an image based on color distance.

* RoughSplit: A function to express large even integers as the sum of two numbers, where neither has prime factors smaller than a specified value.

* SteinerInellipseArea: Calculation of the area of the Steiner inellipse of a given triangle, applying concepts from geometry and complex numbers.
